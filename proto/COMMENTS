To build and run this code (I'm assuming you have a Go environment set up already):
  1) Make the directory $GOPATH/jwasinger.
  2) Move this folder  under that directory.
  3) Run 'go build' in the directory $GOPATH/jwasinger/proto.
  4) Run the executable named 'proto' that appears in $GOPATH/jwasinger/proto.
